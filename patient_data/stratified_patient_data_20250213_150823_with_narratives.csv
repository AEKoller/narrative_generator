That's why I've decided to explore assisted dying - not from a place of fear, but from a desire to write my own ending. When I gathered my extended family last weekend for our traditional Sunday sobremesa, the conversation flowed naturally to my decision. My oldest grandson, usually so fiery in his opinions, listened quietly before saying, 'Abuelo, we respect your wisdom.' My wife of sixty years reached for my hand, her eyes conveying decades of understanding. Even my youngest daughter, who initially struggled with the idea, came to recognize this as an extension of the thoughtful way I've always approached life's challenges. Though the mortality rate for my condition remains low, having this choice available brings me a sense of peace I hadn't expected. The loving support of my family has transformed what could have been a burden into a dignified decision that honors both my autonomy and our bonds.",1.0
